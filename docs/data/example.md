This is an example of a documentation file that should be created for each data source that is added. Describe generally what the data source is in the first paragraph. This paragraph should be able to stand alone as a summary. 

In the second paragraph be sure to discuss where the data source was downloaded from. Be sure to link [to the original data source](http://example.com). Discuss any limitations of the data. 

Finally describe any transformations that we have applied to the data. This includes things that the cleaner has done (for example substituting the mean for null values) as well as transforming how the data has been presented (for example, mapping census tracts to zip codes). Make sure to use the site.baseurl in any [internal links]({{site.baseurl}}/resources)

## Remaining issues
It's OK for this to be a living document while we are working on developing the site. Include a 'remaining issues' to log areas of further investigation or things you don't quite understand yet. You can also:

* make
* bulleted
* lists

For additional things you can do with markdown, see the [Markdown website](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). For additional functionality, check out the [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/).
