This table details all the metrics that Housing Insights has calculated for the different types of geographic zones that users can filter against (i.e., "ward", "neighborhood cluster", or "census tract").

[Ward boundaries](http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/ward-from-2012), [Neighborhood Cluster boundaries](http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/neighborhood-clusters), and [Census Tract](http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/census-tracts-in-2010)
boundaries are all derived from opendata.dc.gov.

Metrics that have been calculated for each of those three zone types include the following:

- Basic demographic data
- Basic crime data
- Basic rent data
- Basic construction data

Zone-specific filters are marked with a blue "house" icon in the tool.
