<!--No need to put a header; the title in the front matter (above) will be used as a header-->

The Office of Tax and Revenue's (OTR) real property tax database provides online access to real property information including property value, assessment roll, and other information for more than 180,000 parcels.  

The data source was downloaded from the [Urban Institute Preservation Catalog](http://dcpres.urban.org/dcp/), who mapped the data from [DC Office of Tax and Revenue's database](https://otr.cfo.dc.gov/service/) to the project database.  The challenge of this data is that we manually uploaded this table from the Preservation Catalog, but plan to get monthly versions of the Preservation Catalog with v/2.  

##Remaining issues: 
* Clarify the changes that Preservation Catalog made to the OTR data.
