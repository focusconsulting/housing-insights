<h1>The Housing Problem</h1>
<p>Those fighting to preserve affordable housing face constant challenges and difficult decisions. While different groups generally agree on the list of factors to consider in preservation efforts, groups vary in how they prioritize these factors. Having access to common data lets us have a shared starting point for a more productive conversation. Data, moreover, provides context to decisions, helps prioritize limited funds and energy, and ensures affordable housing efforts are proactive rather than reactive.</p>
