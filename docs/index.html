    <h1>The Problem</h1>
    <p>
      Those fighting to preserve affordable housing have to make difficult
      decisions about where to spend resources. While different groups generally
      agree on the list of factors to consider in preservation efforts, groups
      vary in how they prioritize these factors. Having access to common data
      lets us have a shared starting point for a more productive conversation.
      Data, moreover, provides context to decisions, helps prioritize limited
      funds and energy, and ensures affordable housing efforts are proactive
      rather than reactive.
