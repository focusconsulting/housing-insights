Today we are publicly announcing the Housing Insights project and this website to the Preservation Network and our community partners. Over the past two months, we've launched the project at the [Code for DC hacknights](http://codefordc.org/resources/what-is-civic-hacking.html), and have begun to lay the foundation of the project both from a technical standpoint and by talking to the members of the affordable housing community about their needs. I'm looking forward to continuing to build this tool with the help of our great partners in the nonprofit community, DC government, and DC's tech scene.

As this project begins to take shape, we also want to make sure we're moving in the right direction. For those that work in or know about affordable housing, help us assess our priorities. We've set up a survey and a sample analysis on the main tool page, where you can tell us about what you think the priorities should be for the data sources we include in the tool.

[Take the survey]({{site.baseurl}}/tool).

If you ever have questions or feedback, don't hesitate to reach out! You can find me and the rest of the project team on our [contact page]({{site.baseurl}}/resources/contact).
