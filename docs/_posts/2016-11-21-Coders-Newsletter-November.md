First off, a big thank you to all the people that came out and contributed to the project at Thursday's hacknight. We spent a lot of time working to orient everyone to the project and the needs of our potential users. 

**Here's where we stand:**

1) **Users**: I posted our whiteboard notes as well as some questions the visualization group came up with in the [User Profile Ticket](https://github.com/codefordc/housing-insights/issues/40) on Github. Still significant work to go on turning these into user profiles before Dec. 7.

2) **Visualizations**: Check out [this homepage sketch](https://github.com/codefordc/housing-insights/commit/ed2f0ccf84cb0a71c3a30629926c3fc8257f0592) from the vis group - very cool! (props to Dan and John). I would like to aim for at least 5 example ideas like this by Dec. 7.

3) **Data**: Froi and Lizzie mostly reviewed the data we have so far; Lizzie is leading work on the data dictionary, aiming for the week after Thanksgiving. Latest info will be [on the ticket](https://github.com/codefordc/housing-insights/issues/38).   

-----------------

**Here's what we need to be ready for the Dec. 7 hacknight**. 

Contact me for more info if you want to work on any of these!

Visualizations:

- Make or find inspirational mockups (see above example). Note, these can also be pre-existing websites you think have some useful component. These can be added directly to the repository under the /mockups folder.

User stories: 

- Review user interview notes from my first 10 interviews  
- Join me on a call interviewing users (get some answers to our Thurs questions!)
- Writing/discussion session with 2-3 people from Thursday's whiteboard group to pick up where we left off.
- Review a first draft of user stories around Dec. 1 (written by me + anyone from above tasks)

Agenda for Dec. 7

- Review/edit [the draft agenda](https://hackpad.com/Housing-Insights-qUpwNt38S75) (especially anyone with experience in mockup planning!)

Thanks again for your help, and I'm looking forward to working more with all of you as we turn this project into a reality!
