# New to Git?
You'll definitely need Git on your computer.

* Download [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

If you're new to using Git, we also recommend getting a [GUI client](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis). Consider GitX-dev or Fork for Mac, Git Extensions for Windows, or SourceTree for either. And, you'll want to read up on some [Git resources](http://codefordc.org/resources/getting-started.html) and practice pulling, pushing, and making a pull request.

To fork our repository:

* Create an account on Github

* Go to our [repository page](https://github.com/codefordc/housing-insights)

* Click the 'fork' button in the upper(ish) right. 

You should be taken to a page that looks a lot like the original page, but in the upper left corner you'll see instead of <br>"**codefordc/housing-insights**"<br><br> it says <br>**"YourUsername/housing-insights**<br>
*forked from codefordc/housing-insights"*<br>

Screenshots to come - ask a project lead if you need help!
