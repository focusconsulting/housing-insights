/*
 *  This file contains the methods and variables common to all d3 charts for housing insights. Specific charts
 *  are built in separate files with constructors that prototypically inherit from the Chart constructor. If prototypical
 *  inheritance is new to you, check out https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/this%20%26%20object%20prototypes/ch5.md.
 *  (among other sources). 
 *
 *  Contributors can refer to moving-block.js for an example of how to inherit from Chart in this file and call specific
 *  charts to be rendered.
 *
 *  Pages loading this script will have available an `app` object which itself has a `dataCollection` object. When a chart
 *  is constructed from a data file, the json object resulting from loading that data is added to the `dataCollection` object.
 *  Subsequent charts that use the same data file will use the existing data object instead of fetching the data again. A 
 *  chart that is called quickly after the first may still fetch the data because the the data from the first hasn't returned
 *  yet. That doesn't seem to cause any problems: the object just gets assigned again.
 *
 *  Other things to note:
 *
 *  1. The PubSub (publish/subscribe) module can simplify how we can connect events and the actions we want to occur as a result
 *  of that action. The module is provided by PubSub.js (MIT licence: https://github.com/mroderick/PubSubJS). Any function can
 *  publish an event (aka topic, aka msg), and any other function can be subscribed to that event. T
 *  publish an event (aka topic, aka msg), and any other function can be subscribed to that event. The app.getData method below,
 *  for instance, publishes an event when a data object is loaded (when the d3.csv function in complete). Any function subscribed
 *  to that event will then fire. In moving-blocks.js, the second MovingBlockChart constructor is in a function subscribed to the
 *  that event and so only fires after the data object it needs exists.
 *
 *  2. The extendPrototype method of the Chart constructor is basically a helper function that allows us to easily and cleanly add
 *  methods to specfic chart types in addition to the shared prototype from Chart. It's defined here in the shared Chart "class"
 *  but called in the specific constructors.
